# Pixel Perfect - AI-Powered Media Resizer

**Tagline:** _Your content, intelligently resized. Upload once, post anywhere._


## 🚀 Overview

Pixel Perfect is a full-stack AI-powered SaaS application designed to solve a common and frustrating problem for content creators: resizing and optimizing media for different social media platforms. Instead of manually cropping images or trimming videos, users can simply upload their media, and our application uses Cloudinary's powerful AI to generate perfectly framed, content-aware images and smart video previews.

This project is built with a modern, scalable tech stack, featuring Next.js for the frontend and backend, Prisma with NeonDB for the database, and Clerk for secure user authentication.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🤖 AI Content-Aware Image Resizing:** Upload an image and instantly generate versions for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and more. The AI automatically detects the main subject to ensure it's never awkwardly cropped.
- **🎬 AI Smart Video Previews:** Instead of a static thumbnail, the application generates dynamic, engaging video previews (similar to YouTube) by using AI to select the most interesting segments of your video.
- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Full user management system with sign-up, sign-in, and protected routes, powered by Clerk.
- **☁️ Cloud-Based Media Management:** All media is efficiently handled, stored, and transformed by Cloudinary, ensuring fast delivery and optimization.
- **⚡ Modern & Performant:** Built with Next.js 14 (App Router) for a fast, server-rendered user experience.
- **💾 Serverless Database:** Uses Prisma ORM with a serverless NeonDB (Postgres) database for scalability and ease of use.
